# Operators for the operation will be listed within parenthesis.

# Below is an expression.
2 + 2 

# Below is an exponent(**) operation.
4 ** 3

# Below is a Modulus/remainder(%) operation.
12 % 10

# Below is the Integer division/floored quotient(//) operation.
40 // 4 

# Below is the Division(/) operation.
32 / 4

# Below is the Multiplication(*) operation.
5 * 5

# Below is the Subtraction(-) operation.
10 - 5

# Below is the Addition(+) operation.
4 + 4

# The order of operations (also called precendence) of python
# math operators is similar to that of mathematics.
# You can use parentheses to override the usual precendence
# if you need to.

# Below is a string concatentation(+ when strings) operation.
'Alice' + 'Bob'

# Below is string replication, when multiply str by int.
'Alice' * 6
# The * operator can be used with only two numeric values
# (for multiplication), or one string value and one integer
# value (for string replication). Otherwise, Python will just
# display an error message.

# You'll store values in variables with an assignment statement.
# An assignment statement consists of a variable name, an 
# equal sign (=) (called the assignment operator), and the value 
# to be stored. If you enter the assignment statement spam = 42,
# then a variable named spam will have the integer value 42 stored
# in it.
spam = 40

eggs = 2
spam + eggs
